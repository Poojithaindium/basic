Algorithm to find the second largest number in a list of numbers is as follows:

1.Read list
2.Initialize two variables,largest and second_largest 
3.Loop through each number in the list.
4.If the number is greater than the largest,make the second_largest to largest and largest as the current number.
5.Otherwise, if the number is greater than the second_largest,make the second_largest as the current number.
6.After the loop, the second_largest variable will contain the second largest number in the list.
